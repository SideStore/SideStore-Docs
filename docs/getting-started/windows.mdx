Please make sure that on your machine the non-Microsoft Store versions of [iCloud](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe) and [iTunes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210384) are installed, if you are running Windows. Before you start, make sure to have all steps completed found in the [Prerequisites](prerequisites), and that you have a [Pairing File](pairing-file)!

The non-Microsoft Store version of iCloud was removed from Apple’s website sometime in mid-September, 2022. The above link directs to an older version of iCloud that is still compatible, and still available directly from Apple’s servers.

1. Download and run AltServer from [AltStore's website](https://altstore.io/).
2. Download the SideStore IPA which you can find [here](https://github.com/sidestore/sidestore/releases/latest/download/sidestore.ipa).
3. Hold shift and click on the AltServer tray icon. Click "Sideload .ipa", and select the SideStore IPA file.
4. Approve the "Developer App" with your Apple ID's email.
    * You can find this in Settings, under "General", and then "VPN & Device Management".
5. Open SideStore, select your pairing file, and sign in with your Apple ID.

When you finish, then follow the [post-install instructions](post-install).
