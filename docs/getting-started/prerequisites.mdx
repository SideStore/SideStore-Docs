SideStore's installation process can seem tricky, but with the ***one-time*** use of a computer, and some time, you'll have SideStore on your device!

## Requirements

To install SideStore, you will need:
- An iOS or iPadOS device running iOS or iPadOS 14 or higher.
- A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer (Linux support is experimental).
- An Apple ID.
- The WireGuard iOS/iPadOS app.
- Some time (This is a quick process, but you should leave time for troubleshooting).

Users of iOS/iPadOS 16 or higher *must* have Developer Mode enabled. Do this by:
1. Open the Settings app.
2. Go to the 'Privacy and Security' section.
3. Turn on 'Developer Mode' at the bottom.

> **Note:** You will only see the 'Developer Mode' option after you have successfully installed SideStore.

## StosVPN

SideStore utilizes an on-device VPN which allows SideStore to communicate with internal services.

1. Download the StosVPN app from the [Official App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051).
2. Enable the VPN.

This VPN is required to be on any time you use SideStore, as most functions will not work without it.
