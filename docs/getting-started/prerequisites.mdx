SideStore's installation process can seem tricky, but with the ***one-time*** use of a computer, and some time, you'll have SideStore on your device!

## Requirements

To install SideStore, you will need:
- An iOS or iPadOS device running iOS or iPadOS 14 or higher.
- A Windows, macOS, or Linux computer (Linux support is experimental).
- An Apple ID
- The WireGuard iOS/iPadOS app.
- And some time (This is a quick process, but you should leave time for troubleshooting).

Users of iOS/iPadOS 16 or higher *must* have Developer Mode enabled. Do this by:
1. Open the Settings app.
2. Go to the 'Privacy and Security Section'
3. Turn on 'Developer Mode' at the bottom.

> **Note:** You will only see the 'Developer Mode' option after you have successfully installed SideStore.

## WireGuard

SideStore utilizes an on-device WireGuard VPN which allows SideStore to communicate to internal services.

1. Download the WireGuard app from the [Official App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1441195209).
2. Also, download the WireGuard config found [here.](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/releases/download/0.3.1/SideStore.conf)
3. Open WireGuard, and press the 'Add a Tunnel' or '+' buttons.
4. Select 'Create from file or archive', and choose the SideStore.conf file.
5. Your device may ask if you want to 'Allow VPN Configurations', choose 'Allow' and authenticate.
6. Toggle on the SideStore VPN option.

This VPN is required to be on any time you use SideStore, as most functions will not work without it.
