Follow the steps here to fix this error:

1. Install [Feather](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/latest).
2. Import the IPA with this issue to Feather, as well as any random .mobileprovision and .p12 file (they can be expired since we are just using this app to reallocate the headers of the IPA).
3. Sign the IPA with the certificate you imported.
4. Open the signed app in files and pack it back to IPA.
5. Install the packed IPA in SideStore.
