## Installation

### I followed the instructions, but I still can't install SideStore.

#### Mac Instructions
1. **Trust Device**: After connecting your iOS device to your Mac, ensure you have said “Trust” on both your Mac and iOS device. You can verify this by:
   - Opening Finder (macOS 10.15 Catalina or later) or iTunes (macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier).
   - Disconnect and reconnect your phone to your mac and check if a dialog box appears asking if you want to trust the device.
2. **Use Another Apple ID**: Try using another Apple ID. If needed, you can [create a new Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!\&page=create) specifically for SideStore use for free.

#### Windows Instructions
1. **Trust Device**: After connecting your iOS device to your Windows computer, ensure you have selected “Trust” on both your computer and iOS device. You can verify this by:
   - Opening iTunes and checking if a dialog box appears asking if you want to trust the device.
2. **Run AltServer as Administrator**: Right-click on AltServer and select “Run as Administrator” to ensure proper permissions.
3. **Use Another Apple ID**: Try using another Apple ID. If needed, you can [create a new Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!\&page=create) specifically for SideStore for free.
4. **Non-Microsoft Store Version of iTunes and iCloud**:
   - If you installed iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store, you’ll need to uninstall them.
   - Download and install the non-Microsoft Store versions of iTunes and iCloud using the following links:
     - [Download iCloud](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe)

## Sign-In Issues

### SideStore Freezing or Displaying an Error Code During Sign-In

If you encounter freezing or error codes while attempting to sign in to SideStore, there could be several potential causes. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Change the Anisette Server:**
   The most common solution is to switch to a different Anisette server. Anisette servers may occasionally experience downtime. Switching to an alternative server typically resolves the issue. Do this:
   - Open SideStore settings.
   - Scroll down to the "Anisette Server" option.
   - Select a different server from the list.
   - You might need to try a few servers from the list and find which works best for you.

2. **Host Your Own Anisette Server:**
   If you prefer, you can set up your own Anisette server. Detailed instructions for hosting an Anisette server are available in the official documentation and can be found [here](https://docs.sidestore.io/docs/advanced/anisette).

### Verification Code Not Received When Signing In with Apple ID

Another common issue during sign-in is not receiving a verification code when using your Apple ID with SideStore. This can be resolved by following these steps:

**For iOS versions below 18.1:**

1. Open the "Settings" app.
2. Tap on your name at the top of the screen.
3. Navigate to "Sign-In and Security."
4. Select "Two-Factor Authentication."
5. Choose "Get Verification Code."

**For iOS versions 18.1 and above:**

1. Visit [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com) on a web browser.
2. Click "Sign In."
3. You may be prompted with see two options: "Sign In" and "Use Different Apple Account."
   - Select the bottom option, "Use Different Apple Account."
4. Enter your Apple ID and password (don't use a passkey).
5. Apple will send you a verification code.
   - Use this code in SideStore to complete the sign-in process.


## Can't Refresh or Install Apps

### Resolving No Wi-Fi or VPN Error

1. Enable Airplane Mode and connect to a stable Wi-Fi network.
2. Ensure that Apple domains and the domain for your anisette server are not restricted. Check the following:
   - Turn off any DNS servers blocking domains such as `ocsp.apple.com`
   - Disconnect from school/work Wi-Fi, try connecting to a restriction-free network.
3. Verify VPN is connected in StosVPN.
4. Turn StosVPN off, then back on, and wait a few seconds in SideStore before trying to refresh.
5. Regenerate your pairing file.
   - If none of the above worked, it is very likely that the pairing file is corrupted. You can reference the documentation on how to create a new pairing file [here](/docs/installation/pairing-file).


## Cannot Choose Pairing File

### If you are unable to select a pairing file in SideStore, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Reimport Pairing File**: Use idevice pair to regenerate and import your pairing file to your device. If idevice pair doesn't work, try jitterbugpair and follow the steps below.
2. **Check File Extension**: Make sure your pairing file's extension ends with `.mobiledevicepairing` or `.plist`. If it doesn't, double-check to see if you had zipped your pairing file before sending it to your phone. Failing to do so may lead to the file being corrupted during transport.
3. **Move Pairing File**: If you are unable to select the pairing file from within the app, rename the file to `ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing` and try moving the pairing file to the root directory of the SideStore folder in the Files app in "On My iPhone/iPad". 
4. **Certificate Signing**: When signing SideStore with a certificate, you won't be able to select the pairing file from within the app. You can try the fix mentioned above. If you do not see the SideStore folder in the Files app, connect your phone to your computer, and you can drag and drop the pairing file to the files of the SideStore app. Make sure to change it to the name mentioned above.

## AltServer

### What if I need to use the Windows Store version of iCloud?

AltServer requires that you install iCloud directly from Apple in order to authenticate your Apple ID. If you want or need to use the Windows Store version as well, you can follow these alternate instructions copied from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/rp5buz/tutorial\_how\_to\_use\_altserver\_if\_you\_have\_to\_use/?utm\_source=share\&utm\_medium=ios\_app\&utm\_name=iossmf) and updated:

1. Download and install [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) from the official Apple website here ([64-bit](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/itunes12/001-80053-20210422-E8A3B28C-A3B2-11EB-BE07-CE1B67FC6302/iTunes64Setup.exe) or [32-bit](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/itunes12/001-80042-20210422-E8A351F2-A3B2-11EB-9A8F-CF1B67FC6302/iTunesSetup.exe).
2. Download and install iCloud from the official Apple website [here](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe).
3. Locate your "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Apple" folder. Copy the "Apple Application Support" and "Internet Services" folders, then create a new folder somewhere you won't lose it, name it anything you want, and paste them in.
4. Remove iCloud from your computer. **DO NOT** remove iTunes! (Also, **NEVER** remove the "Apple Mobile Device Support" or the "Apple Application Support" that are installed alongside iTunes and iCloud.)
5. Install [iCloud](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PKTQ5699M62) from the Windows Store.
6. Download and install [AltServer](https://cdn.altstore.io/file/altstore/altinstaller.zip). When you open it for the first time (with admin rights), click on "Choose Folder..." and select the folder you created in the 3rd step.
