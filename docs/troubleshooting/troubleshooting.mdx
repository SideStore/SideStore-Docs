## Installation

#### I followed the instructions, but I still can't install Sidestore.

### Mac Instructions
1. **Trust Device**: After connecting your iOS device to your Mac, ensure you have said “Trust” on both your Mac and iOS device. You can verify this by:
   - Opening Finder (macOS 10.15 Catalina or later) or iTunes (macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier).
   - Disconnect and reconnect your phone to your mac and check if a dialog box appears asking if you want to trust the device.
2. **Use Another Apple ID**: Try using another Apple ID. If needed, you can [create a new Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!\&page=create) specifically for Sidestore for free.

### Windows Instructions
1. **Trust Device**: After connecting your iOS device to your Windows computer, ensure you have said “Trust” on both your computer and iOS device. You can verify this by:
   - Opening iTunes and checking if a dialog box appears asking if you want to trust the device.
2. **Run AltServer as Administrator**: Right-click on AltServer and select “Run as Administrator” to ensure proper permissions.
3. **Use Another Apple ID**: Try using another Apple ID. If needed, you can [create a new Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!\&page=create) specifically for Sidestore for free.
4. **Non-Microsoft Store Version of iTunes and iCloud**:
   - If you installed iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store, you’ll need to uninstall them.
   - Download and install the non-Microsoft Store versions of iTunes and iCloud using the following links:
     - [Download iCloud](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe)
     - [Download iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64/)


## Sign-In Issues

#### Sidestore Freezing or Displaying an Error Code During Sign-In

If you encounter freezing or error codes while attempting to sign in to Sidestore, there could be several potential causes. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Change the Anisette Server:**
   The most common solution is to switch to a different Anisette server. Anisette servers may occasionally experience downtime. Switching to an alternative server typically resolves the issue. Do this:
   - Open Sidestore settings.
   - Scroll down to the "Anisette Server" option.
   - Select a different server from the list.
   - You might need to try a few servers from the list and find which works best for you.

2. **Host Your Own Anisette Server:**
   If you prefer, you can set up your own Anisette server. Detailed instructions for hosting an Anisette server are available in the official documentation and can he found [here](https://docs.sidestore.io/docs/advanced/anisette).

#### Verification Code Not Received When Signing In with Apple ID

Another common issue during sign-in is not receiving a verification code when using your Apple ID with Sidestore. This can be resolved by following these steps:

**For iOS versions below 18.1:**

1. Open the "Settings" app.
2. Tap on your name at the top of the screen.
3. Navigate to "Sign-In and Security."
4. Select "Two-Factor Authentication."
5. Choose "Get Verification Code."

**For iOS versions 18.1 and above:**

1. Visit [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com) on a web browser.
2. Click "Sign In."
3. When prompted, you will see two options: "Sign In" and "Use Different Apple Account."
   - Select the bottom option, "Use Different Apple Account."
4. Enter your Apple ID and password.
5. Apple will send you a verification code.
   - Use this code in Sidestore to complete the sign-in process.


## Can't Refresh or Install Apps

#### Resolving No Wi-Fi or VPN Error

1. Disable your cellular data / connect to a stable Wi-Fi network.
2. Ensure that Apple domains, and the domain for your anisette server, are not restricted. Check the following:
   - Turn off any DNS blocking domains such as `oscp.apple.com`
   - Disconnect from school/work Wi-Fi, try connecting to a restriction-free network.
3. Verify VPN is connected in StosVPN.
4. Turn StosVPN off, then back on, and wait a few seconds in SideStore before trying to refresh.
5. Create a brand new pairing file.
   - If none of the above worked it is very likely that the pairing file is corrupted. You can reference the documentation on how to create a new pairing file [here](/docs/installation/pairing-file). 
   - After creating a new pairing file, go to Sidestore settings and press "Reset pairing file", then choose the new pairing file you just created.


## Cannot Choose Pairing File

#### If you are unable to select a pairing file in Sidestore, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Check File Extension**: Make sure your pairing file's extension ends with `.mobiledevicepairing` or `.plist`. If it doesn't, double-check to see if you had zipped your pairing file before sending it to your phone. Failing to do so may lead to the file being corrupted during transport.
2. **Move Pairing File**: If you are unable to select the pairing file from within the app, rename the file to `ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing` and try moving the pairing file to the root directory of the SideStore folder in the Files app in "On My iPhone/iPad". 
2. **Certificate Signing**: When signing Sidestore with a certificate, you won't be able to select the pairing file from within the app. You can try the fix mentioned above. If you do not see the Sidestore folder in the Files app, connect your phone to your computer, and you can drag and drop the pairing file to the files of the Sidestore app. Ensure to change it to the name mentioned above.


## AltServer

#### AltStore says “Could not find AltServer” when trying to sideload or refresh apps.

AltServer must be running on a computer connected to the same Wi-Fi as AltStore in order to sideload or refresh apps. If AltServer is running on the same Wi-Fi network as AltStore and you're still receiving this error, try the following:

- Are you on public/work/school Wi-Fi? If so, your Wi-Fi might be preventing devices from discovering each other. Try connecting your computer to your phone’s hotspot and trying again. (If you're using an iPad, make sure it's connected to your hotspot as well.)
- Have you said “Trust” on both your Mac and iOS device after connecting your device to your Mac? You can check by Finder (macOS 10.15 Catalina or later) or iTunes (macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier) and seeing if a dialog box pops up asking if you want to trust your phone.
- (Windows) Your firewall might be blocking incoming network connections to AltServer. You must enable network access for AltServer in your firewall settings for it to receive refreshed apps from AltStore.
- (Windows) Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you’ll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.
- Finally, try plugging your iPhone or iPad into your computer. This should fix all connectivity problems, but does mean AltStore may not be able to automatically refresh apps for you in the background over Wi-Fi.

#### I’m unable to change my network settings to allow devices to communicate with each other (such as on school/work/public Wi-Fi).

You can always sideload and refresh apps without Wi-Fi by plugging your iPhone or iPad into your computer. However, this means AltStore may not be able to refresh apps for you in the background over Wi-Fi.

## AltJIT

#### AltServer says “JIT could not be enabled for [App]".

This could happen for a number of reasons. If you’re experiencing this issue, please check the following:

- Make sure the app you are trying to enable JIT for is running in the foreground on your device.
- Are you on public/work/school Wi-Fi? If so, your Wi-Fi might be preventing devices from discovering each other. Try connecting your computer to your phone’s hotspot and trying again. (If you're using an iPad, make sure it's connected to your hotspot as well.)
- Have you said “Trust” on both your Mac and iOS device after connecting your device to your Mac? You can check by Finder (macOS 10.15 Catalina or later) or iTunes (macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier) and seeing if a dialog box pops up asking if you want to trust your phone.
- (Windows) Firewall might be blocking incoming network connections to AltServer. You must enable network access for AltServer in your firewall settings for it to receive refreshed apps from AltStore.
- (Windows) Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you’ll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.
- You may need to make sure iTunes and iCloud are running on your computer as well.
- Finally, try plugging your iPhone or iPad into your computer. This should fix all connectivity problems, but does mean AltStore may not be able to automatically refresh apps for you in the background over Wi-Fi.

#### What if I need to use the Windows Store version of iCloud?

AltStore requires that you install iCloud directly from Apple in order to authenticate your Apple ID. If you need to use the Windows Store version instead, you can follow these alternate instructions copied from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/rp5buz/tutorial\_how\_to\_use\_altserver\_if\_you\_have\_to\_use/?utm\_source=share\&utm\_medium=ios\_app\&utm\_name=iossmf):

1. Download and install [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) from the official Apple website. Make sure to **scroll down** and click on "Windows" next to the "Looking for other versions?" text.
2. Download and install [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283) from the official Apple website. Make sure to **scroll down** and click on the link in this text: "\* On Windows 7 and Windows 8, you can _download iCloud for Windows on Apple's website_".
3. Locate your "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Apple" folder. Copy the "Apple Application Support" and "Internet Services" folders, then create a new folder, name it anyway you want, and paste them in.
4. Remove iCloud from your computer. **DO NOT** remove iTunes! (Also, **NEVER** remove the "Apple Mobile Device Support" or the "Apple Application Support" that are installed alongside iTunes and iCloud.)
5. Install [iCloud](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PKTQ5699M62) from the Windows Store.
6. Download and install [AltServer](https://altstore.io/). When you open it for the first time, click on "Choose Folder...", and locate the folder you created in the 3rd step.
