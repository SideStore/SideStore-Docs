## Installation

### I followed the instructions, but I still can't install SideStore.

#### Mac Instructions
1. **Trust Device**: After connecting your iOS device to your Mac, ensure you have said “Trust” on both your Mac and iOS device. You can verify this by:
   - Opening Finder (macOS 10.15 Catalina or later) or iTunes (macOS 10.14 Mojave and earlier).
   - Disconnect and reconnect your phone to your mac and check if a dialog box appears asking if you want to trust the device.
2. **Use Another Apple ID**: Try using another Apple ID. If needed, you can [create a new Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!\&page=create) specifically for SideStore use for free.

#### Windows Instructions
1. **Trust Device**: After connecting your iOS device to your Windows computer, ensure you have selected “Trust” on both your computer and iOS device. You can verify this by:
   - Opening iTunes and checking if a dialog box appears asking if you want to trust the device.
2. **Use Another Apple ID**: Try using another Apple ID. If needed, you can [create a new Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!\&page=create) specifically for SideStore for free.


## Sign-In Issues

### SideStore Freezing or Displaying an Error Code During Sign-In

If you encounter freezing or error codes while attempting to sign in to SideStore, there could be several potential causes. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Change the Anisette Server:**
   The most common solution is to switch to a different Anisette server. Anisette servers may occasionally experience downtime. Switching to an alternative server typically resolves the issue. Do this:
   - Open SideStore settings.
   - Scroll down to the "Anisette Server" option.
   - Select a different server from the list.
   - You might need to try a few servers from the list and find which works best for you.

2. **Host Your Own Anisette Server:**
   If you prefer, you can set up your own Anisette server. Detailed instructions for hosting an Anisette server are available in the official documentation and can be found [here](https://docs.sidestore.io/docs/advanced/anisette).

### Verification Code Not Received When Signing In with Apple ID

Another common issue during sign-in is not receiving a verification code when using your Apple ID with SideStore. This can be resolved by following these steps:

**For iOS versions below 18.1:**

1. Open the "Settings" app.
2. Tap on your name at the top of the screen.
3. Navigate to "Sign-In and Security."
4. Select "Two-Factor Authentication."
5. Choose "Get Verification Code."

**For iOS versions 18.1 and above:**

1. Visit [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com) on a web browser.
2. Click "Sign In."
3. You may be prompted with see two options: "Sign In" and "Use Different Apple Account."
   - Select the bottom option, "Use Different Apple Account."
4. Enter your Apple ID and password (don't use a passkey).
5. Apple will send you a verification code.
   - Use this code in SideStore to complete the sign-in process.


## Can't Refresh or Install Apps

### Resolving No Wi-Fi or VPN Error

1. Enable Airplane Mode and connect to a stable Wi-Fi network.
2. Ensure that Apple domains and the domain for your anisette server are not restricted. Check the following:
   - Turn off any DNS servers blocking domains such as `ocsp.apple.com`
   - Disconnect from school/work Wi-Fi and connect to a restriction-free network.
3. Verify VPN is connected in StosVPN.
4. Turn StosVPN off, then back on, and wait a few seconds in SideStore before trying to refresh.
5. [Reimport your pairing file using iloader](../advanced/pairing-file).
