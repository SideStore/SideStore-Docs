### Unable to Launch SideStore
#### Cause
Multiple possible causes.
#### Resolution
1. Make sure you installed SideStore through AltServer
2. Reinstall SideStore

If the above doesn't work, do the following:

1. Delete SideStore and all apps that you have installed from SideStore.
2. Reinstall SideStore.
3. Import your pairing file and login. (It will give you a prompt to refresh SideStore, select no)
4. Install the `sidestore.ipa` file to your device.
5. Import the `sidestore.ipa` file into SideStore like how you would install any other IPA.
6. This will allow Sidestore to do a clean refresh, and hopefully fix the issue.
