If this process is successful, SideStore will open your device to your Home Screen (accompanied by a notification). SideStore will be available again within a few seconds.

Your pairing file may expire if you update or reset your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. If this happens, you'll need to replace it using [this guide](../advanced/pairing-file). This also occurs at random times because of Apple's software.
