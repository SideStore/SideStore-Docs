Before you start, make sure to download all software and complete all setup found in [prerequisites](prerequisites)!

## Installing SideStore
1. Connect your iDevice to your computer via cable. If you are prompted, trust the computer and enter your passcode.
2. Open iloader.
3. Sign in to an Apple Account (It doesn't need to be the account associated with the device. Remember that it is case-sensitive!).
4. Select your iDevice.
5. Select 'Install SideStore (Stable)'.

### On your iDevice
Do the following:
1. Open the Settings app.
2. Navigate to 'General', and then 'VPN & Device Management'.
3. Approve the "Developer App" under the Apple Account's email.
4. Navigate to 'Privacy and Security'.
5. Scroll to the bottom, and turn on "Developer Mode". Your phone will restart.
6. Open StosVPN and select 'Connect' (Alternatively, open StikDebug. The VPN should autoconnect.).
7. Open SideStore.
9. Sign in to the Apple Account you used with iloader.
10. Navigate to 'My Apps'.
11. Tap the '7 DAYS' counter to the right of SideStore to manually refresh it ("7" represents the number of days until an app's expiry, it will update dynamically to show the number of days left. Tap it to refresh the associated app.).
12. If you receive a prompt asking to revoke or create a new signing certificate, tap 'Yes' or 'Refresh Now'.

If this process is successful, SideStore will open your device to your home screen (accompanied by a notification), and SideStore will be available again within a few seconds.

Caution, if you update or reset your iDevice, your pairing file may expire, requiring you to replace it using [this guide](../advanced/pairing-file). This also occurs at random times because of Apple's software.
