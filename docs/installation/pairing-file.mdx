iDevice Pair allows us to create a pairing file for programs like SideStore to talk to your device remotely. This is required to use SideStore, or it will not function.

Download iDevice Pair for [Windows (64-bit)](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair/releases/latest/download/iDevicePair--windows-x86_64.exe), [macOS](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair/releases/latest/download/iDevicePair--macos-universal.dmg), or Linux ([x86_64](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair/releases/latest/download/iDevicePair--linux-x86_64.AppImage) or [AArch64](https://github.com/jkcoxson/idevice_pair/releases/latest/download/iDevicePair--linux-aarch64.AppImage)).

## Pairing Instructions

### Windows

1. Install iTunes from Apple's website ([64-bit](https://apple.com/itunes/download/win64) or [32-bit](https://apple.com/itunes/download/win32)).
2. Download `iDevicePair--windows-x86_64.exe` (move it somewhere you won't lose it).
3. Connect your secondary device to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, tap "trust" and type in your passcode.
4. Unlock your device, open iDevice Pair, and select your device in the drop-down menu.
5. Ensure your device is unlocked and opened to the home screen, then select "generate". When a prompt appears on your device, tap "trust". Your pairing file should appear.
6. Ensure your device is still open to the home screen, then scroll down to the SideStore section and select "install". The word "success" should appear in green.

### macOS

1. Download `iDevicePair--macos-universal.dmg`. Open the file and drag `iDevice Pair` to your Applications folder.
3. Connect your secondary device to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, tap "trust" and type in your passcode.
4. Unlock your device, open iDevice Pair, and select your device in the drop-down menu.
5. Ensure your device is unlocked and opened to the home screen, then select "generate". When a prompt appears on your device, tap "trust". Your pairing file should appear.
6. Ensure your device is still open to the home screen, then scroll down to the SideStore section and select "install". The word "success" should appear in green.

### Linux

:::note
The iDevice Pair instructions for Linux are a work-in-progress, but iDevice Pair is pretty intuitive, so you can give it a try without docs if you want. For now, instructions to create a pairing file using JitterbugPair for Linux are below!
:::

These instructions expect that you are familiar with the linux commandline.

1. **Download** `jitterbugpair-linux.zip` from [here](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-linux.zip), then extract it.
2. Open a terminal in the extracted directory.
3. Make the program executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./jitterbugpair
   ```
4. **Set a passcode** for your device if you haven't already. Unlock your device and connect it to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, tap "trust" and type in your passcode.
5. Open your device to the homescreen.
6. Execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./jitterbugpair
   ```
7. The first time you execute the tool, you will get a prompt for your passcode on your secondary device. Type it in, then keep the screen on and unlocked and run the tool again. Type it in, then keep the screen on and unlocked and execute the tool again.
8. JitterbugPair will generate a **pairing file** with the extension `.mobiledevicepairing`.
9. Compress the file into a .zip folder. Then, **transfer the pairing file** to your iOS device using email, cloud storage, or another method you prefer.
