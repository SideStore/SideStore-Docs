idevice pair is a program which creates a Jitterbug pairing file, allowing programs like SideStore to talk to your device remotely. This is required to use SideStore, otherwise it will not function.
:::warning
Caution, if you update or reset your iDevice, your pairing file will expire and you will need to generate a new one. This also occurs at random times, and there is nothing we can do at this point to fix it.
