Before you start, make sure to have all steps completed found in the [prerequisites](prerequisites)!

1. Ensure you have usbmuxd installed and updated by running `sudo apt install -y usbmuxd` in the Linux terminal.
2. Install either Docker or Podman on your machine. 
2. Plug in your secondary iDevice. If you receive a prompt, select "trust" and enter your passcode.

3. Now, run Altcon with Docker or Podman using the following command (may require `sudo`):

Docker setup:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}/:/mnt/ -v /var/run/usbmuxd:/var/run/usbmuxd -v /var/lib/lockdown:/tmp/lockdown ghcr.io/sidestore/altcon
```
Podman setup:
```bash
podman run --rm -it -v ${PWD}/:/mnt/ -v /var/run/usbmuxd:/var/run/usbmuxd -v /var/lib/lockdown:/tmp/lockdown ghcr.io/sidestore/altcon
```
5. Altcon will pair with your device. When you receive another prompt, select "trust" and enter your passcode again.
6. On your secondary device, do the following:
    * Approve the "Developer App" under your Apple ID's email (you can find this in Settings, under "General", and then "VPN & Device Management").
    * Open the Settings app.
    * Navigate to the 'Privacy and Security' section.
    * Turn on 'Developer Mode' at the bottom.

Now, proceed to generate your [pairing file](pairing-file).
