SideStore's installation process may seem tricky, but with the ***one-time*** use of a computer and some time, you'll have SideStore on your device!

## Requirements

To install SideStore, you will need:

- An iPhone/iPad [with a passcode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/119586) running iOS/iPadOS 14 or higher
- A computer (one-time)
- An Apple Account
- A Wi-Fi connection
- Some time (This is a quick process, but you should [leave time for troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/))

## Preparing Your Devices

### On your iPhone/iPad:

SideStore utilizes an on-device VPN which allows SideStore to communicate with internal services.

1. Download the StosVPN app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051).
2. Enable the VPN.

This VPN is required to be turned on any time you wish to install, update, or refresh apps in SideStore.

### On your Mac
1. Download and install iloader for Mac ([M-Series](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-darwin-aarch64.dmg) or [Intel](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-darwin-x64.dmg)).
2. Open Terminal, run `sudo xattr -c ./Applications/iloader.app`, and enter your password if prompted.


## On your Windows PC
1. Download and install [iTunes](https://apple.co/ms).
2. Download the iloader installer ([exe](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-windows-x64.exe) or [msi](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-windows-x64.msi)).
3. Run the installer.

## On your Linux Machine
1. Download and install `usbmuxd` (may be preinstalled for your distro, otherwise install with your package manager).
2. Download and install iloader for your distro ([Debian/Ubuntu](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.deb), [Fedora/openSUSE](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/download/v0.1.3/iloader-linux-x86_64.rpm), [other](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.AppImage)).
