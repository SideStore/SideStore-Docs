SideStore's installation process may seem tricky, but with the ***one-time*** use of a computer and some time, you'll have SideStore on your device!

## Requirements

To install SideStore, you will need:

- An iPhone or iPad [with a passcode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/119586) running iOS/iPadOS 14 or higher
- A [Mac](/docs/installation/mac), [Windows](/docs/installation/windows), or [Linux](/docs/installation/linux) (Linux support is experimental) computer
- An Apple ID
- The StosVPN app (see below)
- A Wi-Fi connection
- Some time (This is a quick process, but you should [leave time for troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/))

## StosVPN

SideStore utilizes an on-device VPN which allows SideStore to communicate with internal services.

1. Download the StosVPN app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051).
2. Enable the VPN.

This VPN is required to be turned on any time you wish to install, update, or refresh apps in SideStore.

## Next Steps 

Next, follow the installation instructions for your operating system!
- [macOS](mac)
