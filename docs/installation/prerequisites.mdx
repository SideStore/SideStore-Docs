## Requirements
To install SideStore, you will need:
- An iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch [with a passcode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/119586) running iOS/iPadOS 15.0 or higher
- A computer running Windows 8 or higher, macOS High Sierra or higher, or an up-to-date Linux distribution; only for initial install
- An Apple Account (also called an Apple ID)
- A Wi-Fi connection
- Some time! This is a quick and easy process, but you should leave time for [troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting)

## Preparing Your Devices
SideStore utilizes an on-device VPN which allows SideStore to communicate with internal services.

1. Install the LocalDevVPN app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/localdevvpn/id6755608044) or from the [AltStore PAL source](https://api.altstore.io/source/adp.se2crid.me?app=com.jkcoxson.LocalDevVPN).
2. Connect to the VPN. If you are prompted to "Allow VPN Configurations", tap 'Allow' and enter your passcode.

This VPN is required to be turned on any time you wish to install, update, or refresh apps in SideStore.

Now, follow the instructions to install [iloader](https://iloader.app) corresponding to your computer's OS:

    1. Download and install `usbmuxd`. It may be preinstalled with your distribution, otherwise you can install it with your package manager: a Google search for "install usbmuxd [distribution name]" might help you.
    2. Download and install iloader for your distribution. It is available as a [DEB](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.deb) for Debian/Ubuntu, [RPM](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-x86_64.rpm) for Fedora/openSUSE, and as an [AppImage](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.AppImage) for others. (There are also community-maintained packages, such as [this one on the Arch Linux AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/iloader-bin), but please know that we cannot guarantee their safety or security. You should always do your due diligence before installing unknown packages onto your system.)
