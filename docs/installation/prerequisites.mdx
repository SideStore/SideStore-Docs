SideStore's installation process may seem tricky, but with the ***one-time*** use of a computer and some time, you'll have SideStore on your device!

## Requirements

To install SideStore, you will need:

- An iPhone/iPad [with a passcode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/119586) running iOS/iPadOS 14 or higher
- A computer (one-time)
- An Apple Account
- A Wi-Fi connection
- Some time (This is a quick process, but you should [leave time for troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/))

## Preparing Your Devices

### On your iPhone/iPad:

SideStore utilizes an on-device VPN which allows SideStore to communicate with internal services.

1. Install the LocalDevVPN app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localdevvpn/id6755608044). If you live in the EU, install [StikDebug](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754) and use its VPN. Note: you can't sideload VPNs properly on a free developer account.
2. Connect to the VPN. If you are prompted to "Allow VPN Configurations", tap 'Allow' and enter your passcode.

This VPN is required to be turned on any time you wish to install, update, or refresh apps in SideStore.

Now, follow the instructions corresponding to your computer's OS:

### On your Mac
1. Download and install iloader for [Mac](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-darwin-universal.dmg).

### On your Windows PC
1. Download and install [iTunes](https://apple.co/ms).
2. Download the iloader installer ([exe](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-windows-x64.exe) or [msi](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-windows-x64.msi)).
3. Run the installer.

### On your Linux Machine
1. Download and install `usbmuxd` (may be preinstalled for your distro, otherwise install with your package manager).
2. Download and install iloader for your distro ([Debian/Ubuntu](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.deb), [Fedora/openSUSE](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-x86_64.rpm), [other](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.AppImage)).
