SideStore's installation process may seem tricky, but with the ***one-time*** use of a computer and some time, you'll have SideStore on your device!

## Requirements

To install SideStore, you will need:

- An iPhone/iPad [with a passcode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/119586) running iOS/iPadOS 14 or higher
- A computer (one-time)
- An Apple Account
- A Wi-Fi connection
- Some time (This is a quick process, but you should [leave time for troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/))

## Preparing Your Devices

### On your iPhone/iPad:

SideStore utilizes an on-device VPN which allows SideStore to communicate with internal services.

1. Install the StosVPN app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stosvpn/id6744003051). If StosVPN is unavailable, you can utilize the [StikDebug](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754) VPN.
2. Connect to the VPN. If you are prompted to "Allow VPN Configurations", select allow and enter your passcode.

This VPN is required to be turned on any time you wish to install, update, or refresh apps in SideStore.

### On your Mac
1. Download and install iloader for Mac ([M-Series](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-darwin-aarch64.dmg) or [Intel](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-darwin-x64.dmg)).
2. If you are met with an error when running iloader, open Terminal, run `sudo xattr -c ./Applications/iloader.app`, and enter your password if prompted.


## On your Windows PC
1. Download and install [iTunes](https://apple.co/ms).
2. Download the iloader installer ([exe](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-windows-x64.exe) or [msi](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-windows-x64.msi)).
3. Run the installer.

## On your Linux Machine
1. Download and install `usbmuxd` (may be preinstalled for your distro, otherwise install with your package manager).
2. Download and install iloader for your distro ([Debian/Ubuntu](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.deb), [Fedora/openSUSE](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/download/v0.1.3/iloader-linux-x86_64.rpm), [other](https://github.com/nab138/iloader/releases/latest/download/iloader-linux-amd64.AppImage)).
