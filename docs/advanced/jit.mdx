title: Enabling JIT
description: A tutorial on how to enable Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation for apps that require it.
---

:::note
iOS 26 has broken JIT once again. An update has been released to StikDebug with a fix, but support is limited. As of writing (Nov 10), the only supported apps are:
* UTM
* Amethyst
* MeloNX
* maciOS
* DolphiniOS (beta)
* Geode

Please keep an eye on our announcements channel in our Discord server and on the [idevice server](https://discord.gg/mACqxMxP3X)'s announcements and compatibility channels for further updates.

There are many methods to enabling JIT, depending on your iOS version. This tutorial will cover the use of StikDebug (formerly StikJIT), as it is the method we currently recommend. For more information, consult the [official StikDebug pairing guide](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug-Guide/blob/main/pairing_file.md). 

As an alternative, SideStore 0.6.2 includes updates to minimuxer, allowing built-in JIT functionality similar to StikDebug. To use this, simply ensure you are connected to LocalDevVPN with either Wi-Fi connected or Airplane Mode enabled, then navigate to "My Apps," longpress the app you wish to enable JIT for, and tap "enable JIT".

## Prerequisites
* An iDevice running iOS/iPadOS 17.4-all iOS 18 versions, excluding 18.4b1. If you are on 17.0-17.3, you must use an alternative such as [SideJITServer](https://github.com/nythepegasus/SideJITServer). SideStore's JIT enabler will only work on iOS 26 if your device is about 4+ years old (non-TXM capable). 

## StikDebug installation procedures:

1. **Install StikDebug**
   Install StikDebug from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754). Note: you can't sideload apps with VPNs on a free account.

:::note Something nice- the VPN present in StikDebug functions the same as one used in SideStore, meaning you can also use it to install and refresh apps in SideStore, similar to LocalDevVPN.

2. **Place the Pairing File:**  
Use iloader to import the same **pairing file** you use for SideStore with iloader. For more information on this process, see [here](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug-Guide/blob/main/pairing_file.md).


### Standard setup procedure (must be done every time you restart your device)

1. **Mount the DDI:**  
   Open StikDebug with Wi-Fi and the VPN connected and the pairing file placed, then force close it and reopen it. This mounts the DDI. StikDebug should now show all green indicators.

## To enable JIT:

1. **Enable VPN:**  
   Start by opening StikDebug on Wi-Fi or with cellular data enabled to activate the built-in VPN. Now, if using cellular data, enable Airplane Mode and reopen the app with the VPN still enabled.
   
2. **Activate JIT:**  
   Select the “Connect by App” button and select an app from the list (must be sideloaded with proper entitlements to appear in the list) to attach a debugger and activate JIT functionality.
