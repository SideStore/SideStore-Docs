title: Enabling JIT
description: A tutorial on how to enable Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation for apps that require it.
---

:::note
iOS 26 has broken JIT once again. A fix is in the works.

There are many methods to enabling JIT, such as AltJIT, SideJITServer, and more. This tutorial will cover the use of StikDebug (formerly StikJIT), as it is the method we currently recommend. For more information, consult the [official StikDebug pairing guide](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug-Guide/blob/main/pairing_file.md). 

As an alternative, SideStore 0.6.2 includes updates to minimuxer, allowing built-in JIT functionality similar to StikDebug. To use this, simply ensure you are connected to StosVPN with either Wi-Fi connected or Airplane Mode enabled, then navigate to "My Apps," longpress the app you wish to enable JIT for, and tap "enable JIT".
:::

## Prerequisites
* An iDevice on iOS/iPadOS 17.4 and up to iOS/iPadOS 18.5, excluding 18.4b1. If you are on 17.0-17.3, you must use an alternative such as [SideJITServer](https://github.com/nythepegasus/SideJITServer). Versions newer than 18.5 are currently unsupported. 
* At least 1 free app slot (if sideloading).

## StikDebug installation with Apple App Store (Doesn't require an app slot)

1. **Install StikDebug**
   Install StikDebug from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754). Something nice- the VPN present in StikDebug is similar to the one used in SideStore, meaning you use it to install and refresh apps as well.

2. **Installation procedures:**
   Follow the standard installation procedures in the usage guide below.


### Standard installation procedures:

1. **Enable VPN:**  
   Start by activating StosVPN (if sideloading StikDebug) or the built-in VPN in the official StikDebug.

2. **Upload the Pairing File:**  
   Import the same **pairing file** you use for SideStore using iDevicePair. For more information on obtaining this pairing file, see [here](/docs/installation/pairing-file).

## To enable JIT:

1. **Enable VPN:**  
   Start by activating the built-in VPN in StikDebug.
   
2. **Activate JIT:**  
   Select the “Enable JIT” button and select an app from the list (must be sideloaded with proper entitlements to appear in the list) to attach a debugger/activate JIT functionality.

### Offline JIT Enabling
To enable JIT offline, activate StosVPN (if sideloading) or the StikDebug VPN. Then, turn both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data OFF when you launch StikDebug (use Airplane Mode). You can then enable JIT as normal.
