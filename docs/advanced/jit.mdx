title: Enabling JIT
description: A tutorial on how to enable Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation for apps that require it.

:::note

There are many methods to enabling JIT, such as AltServer, SideJITServer, and more. This tutorial will cover the use of StikJIT, as it is the method we currently recommend.

:::

## Prerequisites
* An iDevice on iOS/iPadOS 17.4 or above, excluding 18.4b1
* At least 1 free app slot

## Steps
1. If you haven't already, make sure you're using StosVPN rather than Wireguard. StosVPN can be downloaded from the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6744003051). If for whatever reason you cannot install this, the Wireguard VPN can still work for this.
2. Grab the latest .ipa for StikJIT [here](https://nightly.link/0-Blu/StikJIT/workflows/build_ipa/main) and install it as normal.
3. Once installed, open the app and wait for the Developer Disk Image to download and mount. **This requires WiFi.**
4. Press the "Select Pairing File" button and select your pairing file in the file picker. You can use the 'ALTPairingFile.mobiledevicepairing' file in SideStore's folder for this.
5. Once done, the button on the home page will change to say 'Enable JIT'. Press this.
6. Select the app you want to enable JIT for from the selector pop-up. If your desired app is launched, check that JIT has been enabled. If so, congrats!

## Offline JIT Enabling
To enable JIT offline, make sure WiFi and Mobile Data are OFF when you launch StikJIT. You can then enable JIT as normal.
