:::warning
Caution, if you update or reset your iDevice, your pairing file will expire and you will need to reimport it. This also occurs at random times. This is simply because of how Apple's software works, and there is nothing we can do at this point to fix it. This guide instructs you how to manually replace your pairing file with iloader.
:::

## Replacing your pairing file
1. Make sure you have followed the steps in the [install guide](../installation/prerequisites) to install and setup iloader and SideStore. If iloader prompts you to update it, click 'Yes'.
2. For most reliable results, connect your iDevice to your computer via USB cable, but if your device only appears wirelessly, that should work too.
3. Click 'Manage Pairing File'.
4. To the right of "SideStore" and any other apps you wish, click 'Place'. "Pairing file placed successfully!" should appear in green.
