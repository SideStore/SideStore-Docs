Your pairing file will expire and need to be reimported if you update or reset your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch. This also occurs at random times. This is Apple's fault and there is nothing we can do to fix it. This guide instructs you how to manually replace your pairing file with iloader.
:::

## Replacing your pairing file
1. Make sure you have followed the steps in the [install guide](/docs/installation/prerequisites) to install and setup iloader and SideStore. If iloader prompts you to update it, click 'Yes'.
2. For most reliable results, connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer via a USB cable. If your device only appears wirelessly, that should work too.
3. Click 'Manage Pairing File'.
4. To the right of "SideStore" and any other apps you wish, click 'Place'. "Pairing file placed successfully!" should appear in green.
