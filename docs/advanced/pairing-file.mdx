:::warning
Caution, if you update or reset your iDevice, your pairing file will expire and you will need to reimport it. This also occurs at random times. This is simply because of how Apple's software works, and there is nothing we can do at this point to fix it. This guide instructs you how to manually reimport your pairing file into SideStore with iloader.
:::

## Reimporting your pairing file
1. Make sure you have followed the steps in the [install guide](../installation/prerequisites) to install and setup iloader and SideStore.
2. For best results, connect your iDevice to your computer via USB cable, but if your device appears wirelessly that works too.
3. Click "Manage Pairing File"
4. Next to "SideStore" and any other apps you wish, click "Place Pairing File". "Pairing file placed successfully!" should appear in green.
