# Make a Source

SideStore is fully compatible with AltStore Sources (or AltSources). The official AltSource [documentation](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source) provides all the details you need to make your own AltSource. AltSources allow your audience to view, install, and update all your available apps easily using either AltStore and SideStore.

Here are some recommended third-party tools that can assist in creating viewing your AltSources:
- You can use the community-built [AltStudio](https://altstudio.app/) (WIP) to generate you an AltSource automatically using an IPA!
- You can use the community-built [AltSource Browser](https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse/) to view a visual display of your updates to an AltSource draft before finalizing your changes, allowing you to correct any errors before publishing them!

# Distributing your Source

You can create a link to automatically add your AltSource by using this template: 
```
sidestore://source?url=[source url]
```
For more info, see [URL Schema](/docs/advanced/url-schema). It is often helpful to create the link to your AltSource in this format, then put it into a link shortener such as ```tinyurl.com```. However, if a user tries to use a sidestore:// link without SideStore already installed, it will crash, so some documentation may be helpful.

## That's it!

Here are some good existing AltSources you can copy-and-paste into SideStore: The [SideStore Community Source](https://github.com/SideStore/Community-Source), the [official AltStore Source](https://apps.altstore.io), the [StikDebug Source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug/refs/heads/main/repo.json) source, the [LiveContainer Source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer/refs/heads/main/apps.json), and the [DolphiniOS Source](https://altstore.oatmealdome.me).
