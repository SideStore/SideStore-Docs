#### Setting up SideStore for multiple devices on the same account using AltServer (only works with macOS/Windows)
Steps:
1. Setup AltServer on macOS/Windows using instructions above
2. Install AltStore to one device using AltServer 
3. Sign in Apple Account in AltStore
4. Export Certificate
5. Delete AltStore

Then for each device:
1. Install SideStore using AltServer with the same Apple Account (Hold [Option/Mac, Shift/Windows] when clicking AltServer -> Install IPA -> Select SideStore.ipa)
2. Import certificate
3. Sign in Apple Account in SideStore (We need to sign in after importing the certificate otherwise it won't let you sign in without revoking AltStore's certificate)
4. Sideload

When the old certificate expires:
1. SideStore will prompt to reinstall itself on one device
2. After reinstalling, export the certificate

Then for each other device:
1. Import new certificate
2. Sideload SideStore ipa from SideStore

## VPN
### WireGuard
:::note
The SideStore WireGuard VPN **only works on SideStore versions between 0.3.1-0.6.1, and 0.6.3-nightly.4e6756d on**, and is not recommended if you have an alternative available (LocalDevVPN). If you are not on these versions and it doesn't work, **please do not ask for support with this**. 
:::

SideStore utilizes an on-device WireGuard VPN which allows SideStore to communicate with internal services.

1. Download the WireGuard app from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/wireguard/id1441195209).
2. Also, download the WireGuard config found [here](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/releases/download/0.3.1/SideStore.conf).
3. Open WireGuard, and press the 'Add a Tunnel' or '+' button.
4. Select 'Create from file or archive', and choose the SideStore.conf file.
5. Your device may ask if you want to 'Allow VPN Configurations', choose 'Allow' and authenticate.
6. Toggle on the SideStore VPN option.

This VPN is required to be on any time you use SideStore, as most functions will not work without it.

</Tabs>

#### Pairing Instructions

1. Connect your secondary device to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, select `trust` and type in your passcode.
2. Unlock your device, then open `idevice pair` and select your device in the drop-down menu.
3. Ensure your device is unlocked and opened to the home screen, then select `load`. If a prompt appears on your device, tap `trust`. Your pairing file should appear.
4. Ensure your device is still open to the home screen, then scroll down and select `install` underneath "SideStore". `Success` should appear in green.

### JitterbugPair
JitterbugPair (*not* the Jitterbug app) allows us to create a pairing file for programs like SideStore to talk to your device remotely. This is required to use SideStore, or it will not function.

Download JitterbugPair for [Windows (64-bit)](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-win64.zip), [macOS](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-macos.zip), or [Linux](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-linux.zip).

#### Pairing Instructions

:::tip

Depending on your method, when transferring your .mobiledevicepariring file, the file extension might change (usually to .txt or cropping off the "ing"). It is always recommended to zip your pairing file before transferring it. SideStore only accepts .mobiledevicepairing files (or .plist files in older versions).

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
   1. Download JitterbugPair for [macOS](https://github.com/osy/Jitterbug/releases/download/v1.3.1/jitterbugpair-macos.zip).
   2. **Extract** `jitterbugpair-macos.zip`.
   3. **Set a passcode** for your device if you haven't already. Unlock your device and connect it to your computer via cable. If a prompt appears, tap "trust" and type in your passcode.
   4. Open your device to the homescreen.
   5. Find and open the extracted `jitterbugpair` file (it should have a black and green icon) by double-clicking it or right-clicking it and selecting "open". The first time you run the tool, you will get a prompt for your passcode on your secondary device. Type it in, then keep the screen on and unlocked and run the tool again.
   6. If you get the message" "macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware":
      - Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
      - Scroll down to the message about the app
      - Click "Open Anyway," if the program doesn't run automatically, try manually running it again
   7. JitterbugPair will generate a **pairing file** with the extension `.mobiledevicepairing` to your user's home folder.
   8. If you can't find the pairing file:
      - Copy the name of the pairing file generated
      - Paste it into Finder
      - If you ran the program more than once, all pairing files for your device should appear since they share the same name
   9. For best results, compress the file into a .zip folder. Then, **transfer the pairing file** to your iOS device via AirDrop, iCloud/One/Google Drive, email, or another method you prefer.

   7. For best results, compress the file into a .zip folder. Then, **transfer the pairing file** to your iOS device using One/iCloud/Google Drive, email, or another method you prefer.

   On Windows, you might have to execute the program using Command Prompt or Powershell, as double-clicking the `.exe` file doesn't always open it.

   8. In File Explorer, navigate to the folder where jitterbugpair is located.
   9. In the navigation bar where the folder location is, click an empty spot and type `powershell`. It should open a (possibly blue colored) window called PowerShell.
   10. From there, type `./jitterbugpair.exe` and press enter while your device is plugged in.

## SideStore exploits
### SparseRestore (3-app limit)
:::note
The SparseRestore "Bypass 3 app limit" exploit **only works on iOS/iPadOS versions between 17.0 and 18.1 beta 4 (not including 17.7.1)**. If you are not on these versions and it doesn't work, **please do not ask for support with this**. 
:::

#### Prerequisites
* An iPhone or iPad running versions supported by the SparseRestore exploit (see note above).
* At least 1 free app slot.
* SideStore version 0.5.9 or later. You can find the latest versions [here](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/releases).
* To perform this exploit, you MUST have **Find My** turned off on your iPhone or iPad during the process. It will not work otherwise. Here is how you can turn it off:
  - Open the Settings app.
  - Tap on your name at the top.
  - Tap on Find My.
  - Tap on Find My iPhone/iPad.
  - Turn off Find My iPhone/iPad.
  - You may be required to enter your Apple Account password to confirm.
  
  > **Note:** You may still not be able to turn off Find My since having Stolen Device Protection on might prevent you from turning it off. Turn off Stolen Device Protection before trying to turn off Find My.

#### Steps
1. Install SparseBox. This can be done with a variety of methods, but for the purposes of this, install it with SideStore. The latest version can be found [here](https://nightly.link/khanhduytran0/SparseBox/workflows/build/main/artifact.zip) (unzip artifact.zip for the .ipa file).

2. Tick on "Disable App Limit" in SideStore, and make sure SideStore is **closed** (not in background), then open SparseBox.

3. Enable LocalDevVPN, select your pairing file and tap 'Bypass 3-app limit'. This should bring up a log output. Wait for it to say `idevicebackup2 exited with code -18` or `idevicebackup2 exited with code 2`, then close the app. No need to hit apply.

4. Re-open SideStore, and scroll down in SideStore settings. Press "clear cache", this will allow the exploit to be seen by SideStore.

5. Test that the exploit has worked (you may need to install more than one app to test, depending on how many free slots you have). If it throws an error about the limit, reopen SideStore or retry the exploit. If it installs the app, congratulations! You can now have more than 3 apps installed at one time.

#### Notes
Due to certain limitations, this exploit must be done for every 3 additional apps you sideload.

If you want/need Find My for other purposes, you can now turn it back on. However, if you want to install or refresh more apps, you will need to turn it off again.

### MacDirtyCow (3-app limit)
:::note
The MacDirtyCow "Bypass 3 app limit" exploit **only works on iOS/iPadOS versions between 15.0 and 16.1.2**. If you are not on these versions and it doesn't work, **please do not ask for support with this**.
