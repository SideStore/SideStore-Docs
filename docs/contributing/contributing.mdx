# Contributing to SideStore

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SideStore! SideStore is a community driven project, and it's made possible by people like you.

By contributing to this Project (SideStore), you agree to the Developer's Certificate of Origin found in [CERTIFICATE-OF-ORIGIN.md](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/blob/develop/CERTIFICATE-OF-ORIGIN.md). Any contributions to this project after the addition of the Developer's Certificate of Origin are subject to its policy.

There are many ways to contribute to SideStore, so if you aren't a developer, there are still many other ways you can help out:

- [Writing documentation](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore-Docs)
- [Submitting detailed bug reports and suggesting new features](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/issues/new/choose)
- Helping out with support:
    - [Discord](https://discord.gg/sidestore-949183273383395328)
    - [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/discussions)

However, this guide will focus on the development side of things. For now, we will only have setup information here, but you can [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/sidestore-949183273383395328) if you need help after setup.

## Requirements

This guide assumes you:

- are on a Mac
- have Xcode installed
- have basic command line knowledge (know how to run commands, cd into a directory)
- have basic Git knowledge ([GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great tool for beginners, and greatly simplifies working with Git)
- have basic Swift/iOS development knowledge

## Setup

1. **Fork the SideStore repo on GitHub**.

2. **Clone the fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/SideStore.git --recurse
   cd SideStore
   ```
   
   If you are using GitHub Desktop, refer to [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop).

3. **Copy `CodeSigning.xcconfig.sample` to `CodeSigning.xcconfig`** and fill in the values.

4. **(Development only)** Change the value for `ALTDeviceID` in the Info.plist to your device's UDID. Normally, SideServer embeds the device's UDID in SideStore's Info.plist during installation. When running through Xcode you'll need to set the value yourself or else SideStore won't resign (or even install) apps for the proper device.

5. **Finally, open `AltStore.xcworkspace` in Xcode**.

Next, make and test your changes. Then, commit and push your changes using git and make a pull request.

## Prebuilt Binary Information

minimuxer and em_proxy use prebuilt static library binaries built by GitHub Actions to speed up builds and remove the need for Rust to be installed when working on SideStore. [`SideStore/fetch-prebuilt.sh`](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/blob/develop/SideStore/fetch-prebuilt.sh) will be run before each build by Xcode, and it will check if the downloaded binaries are up-to-date once every 6 hours. If you want to force it to check for new binaries, run `bash ./SideStore/fetch-prebuilt.sh force`.

## Building with Xcode

Install cocoapods if required using: `brew install cocoapods`  
Now using commandline on the repository workspace root, perform Pod-Install using: `pod install` command to install the cocoapod dependencies.  
After this you can do regular builds within Xcode.

## Building an IPA for Distribution

Install cocoapods if required using: `brew install cocoapods`  
Now using commandline on the repository workspace root, perform Pod-Install using: `pod install` command to install the cocoapod dependencies.

You can then use the Makefile command: `make build fakesign ipa` in the root directory.  
By default the config for build is: `Release`  
For debug builds: `export BUILD_CONFIG=Debug;make build fakesign ipa` in the root directory.  
For alpha/beta builds: `export IS_ALPHA=1;` or `export IS_BETA=1;` before invoking the build command.  
This will create SideStore.ipa.

```sh
Examples: 

    # cocoapods
    brew install cocoapods
    # perform installation of the pods
    pod install

    # alpha release build
    export IS_ALPHA=1;make build fakesign ipa
    # alpha debug build
    export IS_ALPHA=1;export BUILD_CONFIG=Debug;make build fakesign ipa

    # beta release build
    export IS_BETA=1;make build fakesign ipa
    # beta debug build
    export IS_BETA=1;export BUILD_CONFIG=Debug;make build fakesign ipa

    # stable release build
    make build fakesign ipa
    # stable debug build
    export BUILD_CONFIG=Debug;make build fakesign ipa
```

By default SideStore will build for its default bundleIdentifier `com.SideStore.SideStore` but if you need to set a custom bundleID for commandline builds, once can do so by exporting `BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX` env var:

```sh
    # stable release build
    export BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX=XYZ0123456;make build fakesign ipa
    # stable debug build
    export BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX=XYZ0123456;export BUILD_CONFIG=Debug;make build fakesign ipa
```

**NOTE**: When building from XCode, the `BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX` is set by default with the value of `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`

This can be customized by setting/removing the BUNDLE_ID_SUFFIX in overriding CodeSigning.xcconfig created from CodeSigning.xcconfig.sample

:::warning
The binary created will contain paths to Xcode's DerivedData, and if you built minimuxer on your machine, paths to $HOME/.cargo. This will include your username. If you want to keep your user's username private, you might want to get GitHub Actions to build the IPA instead.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

SideStore requires all contributors to sign off on their commits using the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This serves as our Contributor Code of Conduct and is a simple way to certify that you wrote or have the right to submit the code you are contributing.

### What is the DCO?

By signing off on your commits, you certify that:

- **(a)** The contribution was created in whole or in part by you and you have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or
- **(b)** The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of your knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and you have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications; or  
- **(c)** The contribution was provided directly to you by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and you have not modified it.
- **(d)** You understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution is maintained indefinitely.

### How to Sign Off

To sign off on your commits, simply add the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will automatically add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message:

```
Your commit message

Signed-off-by: SternXD <stern@sidestore.io>
```

### Important Notes

- **All commits should be signed off** - We usually prefer that you sign your commits.
- **Use the correct email** - The email should match your GitHub account
- **Retroactive sign-off** - If you forget to sign off, you can amend your last commit with `git commit --amend -s`

For more details, see the full [Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/blob/develop/CERTIFICATE-OF-ORIGIN.md) document.
