# Create a secondary Apple account

## Requires

- Emailadres (you can use: https://temp-mail.org/)
- Phone number (use one you can actually keep recieving SMS codes for)
- An iDevice (To avoid: This action cannot be completed at this time (-22411))

## Create the account

1. Go to: this [page](https://appleid.apple.com/account).
2. Fill everything in and make sure to supply a phone number where you can keep recieving SMS codes for. You can use your personal number for this.

## Login into your iDevice

3. Logout on your current iDevice and login with you newly created account.

### Why?

When you try to sideload SideStore/an IPA, Apple will try to send a 2FA code but can't (not sure why SMS doesn't work for this).

4. Your iDevice will display the 2FA code once when you'll sideload your IPA. This should only be needed once from the host you sideload from.

5. You can logout on your iDevice once you've entered the 2FA code.
