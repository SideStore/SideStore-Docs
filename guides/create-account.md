# Using a burner Apple ID Account with SideStore
The recommended way to use SideStore is with a burner Apple ID Account (to avoid temporarily losing an important account to log-in's falsely flagged as malicious).

## Requirements

- Email address
- A phone number with access to SMS messages OR a secondary device (to recieve 2FA codes)

NOTE: There are reports of 2FA codes not appearing via SMS when hosting SideServer on Linux, 

## Create an Apple ID account

Go to the [Apple ID website](https://appleid.apple.com/account) to create a new account.

## Configure for use with SideStore

Log out of your existing Apple ID on your Apple device and log in using the newly created Apple ID Account.

## Signing in to SideServer/AltServer

If SideStore was not installed yet, follow the instructions that SideServer provides (You'll be asked to reauthenticate using a 2FA code. You'll be recieving it on the device you recieve SMS messages on or the device logged in to your burner Apple ID).

## Signing in to SideStore

It's as easy as just whipping out your Apple device with SideStore installed on it, and logging in! (You'll be asked to reauthenticate using a 2FA code. You'll be recieving it on the device you recieve SMS messages on or the device logged in to your burner Apple ID). When you're done logging in to SideStore, you can log your secondary device out of your burner Apple ID Account.
