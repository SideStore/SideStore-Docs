# After Install Recommendations

## Refresh SideStore
The first thing you should do after installing SideStore is refreshing it. This will ensure that SideStore will not expire early. To do this, make sure you are connected to the VPN, and go to the "My Apps" section, and tap on the day counter. If the refresh is successful, a blank Safari tab will open.
