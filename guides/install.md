# Installation

The process of installing SideStore onto your device requires the **one time use** of a computer. Following the initial installation, SideStore can be indefinitely refreshed without the use of a local computer.

## Generic Install Requirements

* Personal Computer (Windows, Mac, Linux)
    * _See individual install guides for specific distributions and OS versions_
* iOS device
    * iOS/iPadOS 14+
* Apple ID account

"Burner" Apple IDs are **highly** recommended when using anisette servers created by others. See more about [creating your own anisette server.](/guides/custom-anisette)

You must enable "Developer Mode" in your iOS security settings. Additionally, you must *Trust* your personal developer certificate after installing with your Apple ID.

<!--
With SideStore downloader installed (and it's requirements met), simply connect your iOS device physically to your internet enabled PC. Then using the SideStore downloader, enter your Apple ID credentials (read more about creating a "burner" Apple ID to prevent lockouts) and wait until SideStore is installed on your iOS device homescreen.

You must then enable "Developer Mode" in your iOS security settings. Additionally, you must *Trust* your personal developer certificate.

Finally, open the SideStore app on your homescreen, re-enter the Apple ID credentials used previously, and refresh to ensure that everything is working correctly.
