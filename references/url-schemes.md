# URL Schemes

The following is the list of different URL Schemes that can be used to interact with SideStore. These are incredibly useful because they allow developers to simply put a one-click link on their social media or website, and iOS will open the link directly in SideStore, performing the action(s) specified.

The current list of things you can do using URL Schemes is limited to installing apps and sources, but it will be expanded upon in the future to take multiple inputs and perform a variety of other tasks.

### Install a remotely hosted app

```
sidestore://install?url=[download url]
```

### Add an AltSource

```
sidestore://source?url=[source url]
```
