# Human Content Statement

We pride ourselves in our documentation being written *and* translated by humans,
not by Large Language Models (LLMs), other Artificial Intelligence (AI), or 
machine translators (such as Google Translate or DeepL).

AI writing is often lacking in quality, critical thought, and understanding of
the work being referenced. Machine translated text is often incorrect in context
or translation, and is not fit for official or large scale texts.

Contributors to our documentation should under no circumstance use AI or machine
translation to write or translate documentation. Those found to be using AI or
machine translation will be removed as contributors to the documentation, and any 
current or future pending changes could be considered void.

We encourage you to support human writing and translations, only with such will
you and others grow.
