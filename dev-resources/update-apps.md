**SideStore uses the ordering of versions to determine which versions are "newer."**

To update your app, all you need to do is add a new version entry to the beginning of your versions array. SideStore automatically checks for app updates in the background and will notify users whenever one is available.

SideStore will show that there is an update available when there's a newer version compatible with a user's device. **SideStore does not compare version numbers to determine if there is an update.**
