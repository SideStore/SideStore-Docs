### Unable to Launch SideStore

If the above doesn't work, do the following:

1. Delete SideStore and all apps that you have installed from SideStore
2. Reinstall SideStore
3. Import your pairing file and login. (It will give you a prompt to refresh SideStore, select no)
4. Install the `sidestore.ipa` file to your device
5. Import the `sidestore.ipa` file into SideStore like how you would install any other IPA
6. This will allow SideStore to do a clean refresh, and hopefully fix the issue
