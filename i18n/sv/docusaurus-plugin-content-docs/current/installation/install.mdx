## Installing SideStore
1. Connect your iDevice to your computer via cable. If you are prompted, trust the computer and enter your passcode.
2. Open iloader.
3. Sign in to an Apple Account (it doesn't need to match your device)
4. Select your iDevice
3. Select "Install SideStore".

### On your iDevice
Do the following:
1. Open the Settings app.
2. Navigate to 'General', and then 'VPN & Device Management'.
3. Approve the "Developer App" under the Apple Account's email.
4. Navigate to 'Privacy and Security'.
5. Scroll to the bottom, and turn on 'Developer Mode'. Your phone will restart.
6. Open StosVPN and select 'Connect'.
7. Open SideStore.
9. Sign in to the Apple Account you used with iloader.
10. Navigate to "My Apps".
11. Tap the "x DAYS" button to the right of SideStore, (x is the number of days until an app's expiry).
12. A prompt asking to create a new signing certificate should appear, tap "Refresh Now".

If this process is successful, SideStore will open your device to your home screen, accompanied by a notification, and SideStore will be avaliable again within a few seconds.

Caution, if you update or reset your iDevice, your pairing file will expire and you will need to reimport it using [this guide](../advanced/pairing-file). This also occurs at random times because of Apple's software. 

If you reinstall SideStore using iloader, your certificate may be revoked, requiring you to manually refresh it again. 

If you wish to install SideStore on another device using the same Apple Account, follow [these steps](https://github.com/SideStore/SideStore/pull/1008#issue-3138680291).
