# Make a Source

SideStore is fully compatible with AltStore Sources (or AltSources). The official AltSource [documentation](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source) provides all the details you need to make your own AltSource. AltSources allow your audience to view, install, and update all your available apps easily.

Here are some recommended third-party tools that can assist in creating viewing your AltSources:
- You can use the community-built [AltStudio](https://altstudio.app/) (WIP) to generate you an AltSource automatically using an IPA! (Caution- After using AltStudio to create a source, you must remove the autogenerated-by-default marketplaceID and Build fields, otherwise SideStore will believe it to be a notarized source and prevent your source being added)
- You can use the community-built [AltSource Browser](https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse/) to view a visual display of your updates to an AltSource draft before finalizing your changes, allowing you to correct any errors before publishing them!

# Distributing your Source

You can create a link to automatically add your AltSource by using this template: 
```
sidestore://source?url=[source url]
```
For more info, see [URL Schema](/docs/advanced/url-schema). It is often helpful to create the link to your AltSource in this format, then put it into a link shortener such as `tinyurl.com`. However, if a user tries to use a `sidestore://` link without SideStore already installed, it will crash, so some documentation may be helpful.

## That's it!

Here are some good existing AltSources you can copy-and-paste into SideStore: The [SideStore Community Source](https://github.com/SideStore/Community-Source), the [official AltStore Source](https://apps.altstore.io), the [LiveContainer Source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer/refs/heads/main/apps.json), and the [DolphiniOS Source](https://altstore.oatmealdome.me).
